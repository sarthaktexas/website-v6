This website was created for the new Days of Service initiative. The site was inspired by [Gemma Copeland](https://gemmacope.land) and [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org)'s personal websites.

Most of the Hack Club sites use bright, bold colors and card components sectioning off different parts. This site does quite the opposite featuring a muted red background on the left to separate the left and right, and a monochrome color palette (minus the event logos). Event cards still exist and display pictures in a scrolling marquee.
